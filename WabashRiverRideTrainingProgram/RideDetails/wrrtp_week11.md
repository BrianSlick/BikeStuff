### Week 11

We'll return to the north side of town, and do our first of several rides up to the Klein Brot Haus bakery in Brookston. If the distance seems like a challenge, don't panic! It is 13 miles - a distance we've exceeded several times - to the bakery, where we'll take a nice long break and enjoy pastries. This will be similar to the Wabash River Ride where there is a SAG stop in the middle loaded with snacks. Then we'll retrace our path back home, so think of it as two 13-mile rides back-to-back with a good break in the middle. We'll get up close and personal with some of the wind turbines, but mostly we're going to find out why all of those turbines are there: unrelenting wind!

If you have not attended previous weeks in the program, you're welcome to join us, but this will certainly be on the long side if you are a new rider. The club calendar will frequently have 7- and 11-mile routes for novices that you may want to try first. Alternatively, you're encouraged to try some of our previous routes on your own beforehand to build up your stamina: [Week 1](wrrtp_week1.md), [Week 2](wrrtp_week2.md), [Week 3](wrrtp_week3.md), [Week 4](wrrtp_week4.md), [Weeks 5/6](wrrtp_week5.md), [Week 8](wrrtp_week8.md), [Week 9](wrrtp_week9.md).

**Venue & Misc**

There is ample parking at Kalberer soccer fields, and it has a public restroom that is typically open. We'll try to have some water on hand, but please bring any supplies you may need. It would be a good idea to bring a spare inner tube; Brian can carry lots of stuff, so even if you don't have a place for it, bring it anyway.

If you are not yet a member of the club ([please join!](http://wrcc-in.org/wp/?page_id=85)) and therefore not on the club listserv, feel free to send a note to (brianslick at mac dot com) if you have any questions beforehand, or wish to be notified of cancellations.
