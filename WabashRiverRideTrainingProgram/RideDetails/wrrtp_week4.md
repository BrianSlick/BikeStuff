### Week 4

We will continue with our Celery Bog stomping grounds, but this time we're adding a big hill. We'll take a break or two if needed, but the goal will be to complete the route without stopping. As before, the ride leader will be available for extra distance for those that want it. We should finish by lunch time.

This will be our final ride on sidewalks. Next week we take to the streets!

If you have not attended previous weeks in the program, have no fear! You're still more than welcome to ride with us. You may want to ride previous routes - [Week 1](wrrtp_week1.md), [Week 2](wrrtp_week2.md), [Week 3](wrrtp_week3.md) - on your own beforehand.

There is ample parking at the Lilly Nature Center, and it has a public restroom that is typically open (but I can't promise that year-round). Your ride leader, Brian, drives a red Toyota RAV4 and rides a greenish Giant hybrid bike with a big rear bag and lots of yellow tape. We'll try to have some water on hand, but please bring any supplies you may need. It would be a good idea to bring a spare inner tube; Brian can carry lots of stuff, so even if you don't have a place for it, bring it anyway.

If you are not yet a member of the club ([please join!](http://wrcc-in.org/wp/?page_id=85)) and therefore not on the club listserv, feel free to send a note to (brianslick at mac dot com) if you have any questions beforehand, or wish to be notified of cancellations.
