### Week 10

We're going to take a break from Kalberer this week and explore the south side of town. Mayflower Mill is another common launch point for club rides. This will be our first ride that exceeds 20 miles, and we're going to increase the speed a little more. We'll plan on taking a couple of breaks.

This particular route is a favorite E route of Gary Brouillard. So if you see a ~20-mile E route on the club calendar, it's probably this one or similar.

If you have not attended previous weeks in the program, you're welcome to join us, but this will probably be on the long side if you are a new rider. The club calendar will frequently have 7- and 11-mile routes for novices that you may want to try first. Alternatively, you're encouraged to try some of our previous routes on your own beforehand to build up your stamina.

**Venue & Misc**

There is ample parking at Mayflower Mill Elementary School, however you cannot count on a restroom being available. The route will go by 1, possibly 2, port-a-johns, and we're happy to stop if necessary. We'll try to have some water on hand, but please bring any supplies you may need. It would be a good idea to bring a spare inner tube; Brian can carry lots of stuff, so even if you don't have a place for it, bring it anyway.

If you are not yet a member of the club ([please join!](http://wrcc-in.org/wp/?page_id=85)) and therefore not on the club listserv, feel free to send a note to (brianslick at mac dot com) if you have any questions beforehand, or wish to be notified of cancellations.
