## Wabash River Ride Training Program

Due to the July 4th holiday weekend, there is currently no training program ride planned for Saturday, July 1st. As the date gets closer, we will conduct a poll of participants. If there is enough interest and availability, we might add a group ride. Details will be provided here if that happens.
