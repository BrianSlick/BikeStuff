### Week 6

This week will be a repeat of last week. Our goal this time is to run the route without stopping, or at least go past our previous rest point.

There is currently no program ride scheduled for July 4th weekend. If there is interest amongst participants, we may throw something together last minute. Otherwise, you are encouraged to repeat any of the routes we have already done. Try to push yourself somehow; go faster, go farther without stopping, etc. Also check out the club calendar to see what other rides might be available.

If you have not attended previous weeks in the program, have no fear! You're still more than welcome to ride with us. You may want to ride previous routes - [Week 1](wrrtp_week1.md), [Week 2](wrrtp_week2.md), [Week 3](wrrtp_week3.md), [Week 4](wrrtp_week4.md) - on your own beforehand. The route we did in Week 5 and today is routinely offered on the club calendar as an 11-mile Novice ride.

**Venue & Misc**

There is ample parking at Kalberer soccer fields, and it has a public restroom that is typically open. We'll try to have some water on hand, but please bring any supplies you may need. It would be a good idea to bring a spare inner tube; Brian can carry lots of stuff, so even if you don't have a place for it, bring it anyway.

If you are not yet a member of the club ([please join!](http://wrcc-in.org/wp/?page_id=85)) and therefore not on the club listserv, feel free to send a note to (brianslick at mac dot com) if you have any questions beforehand, or wish to be notified of cancellations.
