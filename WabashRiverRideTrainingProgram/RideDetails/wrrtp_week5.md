### Week 5

For the first time in this program, we will ride on the streets! Please note that the meeting location is different than we have previously used. Kalberer soccer fields are a common launch point for many WRCC rides, and most of our remaining schedule will start from here.

Our goal this week is simply to build some comfort with riding on the street, and pushing our distance and speed envelope a little further.  We will plan on taking 1 break at about the half way point.

This particular route is a favorite novice route of Dennis Figeruoa. So if you see an 11-mile novice route on the club calendar, it's probably this one.

If you have not attended previous weeks in the program, have no fear! You're still more than welcome to ride with us. You may want to ride previous routes - [Week 1](wrrtp_week1.md), [Week 2](wrrtp_week2.md), [Week 3](wrrtp_week3.md), [Week 4](wrrtp_week4.md) - on your own beforehand.

There is ample parking at Kalberer soccer fields, and it has a public restroom that is typically open. We'll try to have some water on hand, but please bring any supplies you may need. It would be a good idea to bring a spare inner tube; Brian can carry lots of stuff, so even if you don't have a place for it, bring it anyway.

If you are not yet a member of the club ([please join!](http://wrcc-in.org/wp/?page_id=85)) and therefore not on the club listserv, feel free to send a note to (brianslick at mac dot com) if you have any questions beforehand, or wish to be notified of cancellations.
