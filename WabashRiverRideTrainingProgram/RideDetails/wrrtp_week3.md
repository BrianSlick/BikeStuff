### Week 3

We will mostly cover familiar ground around Celery Bog, but this time it will be a true loop - a little over 6 miles - without coming back to home in the middle. We'll take a break if needed, but the goal will be to complete the loop without stopping. As before, the ride leader will be available for extra distance for those that want it. We should easily finish by lunch time.

If you missed Weeks 1 or 2 (or both), no sweat! Come on out and join us anyway. If you have time to run the Week 1 and/or Week 2 routes on your own, please do so, but it is not a requirement, and similar to what we will do today.

**Venue & Misc**

There is ample parking at the Lilly Nature Center, and it has a public restroom that is typically open (but I can't promise that year-round). Your ride leader, Brian, drives a red Toyota RAV4 and rides a greenish Giant hybrid bike with a big rear bag and lots of yellow tape. We'll try to have some water on hand, but please bring any supplies you may need. It would be a good idea to bring a spare inner tube; Brian can carry lots of stuff, so even if you don't have a place for it, bring it anyway.

If you are not yet a member of the club ([please join!](http://wrcc-in.org/wp/?page_id=85)) and therefore not on the club listserv, feel free to send a note to (brianslick at mac dot com) if you have any questions beforehand, or wish to be notified of cancellations.
