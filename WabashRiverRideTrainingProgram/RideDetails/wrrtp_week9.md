### Week 9

We're just going for more distance this week. The route is a combination of routes we have previously covered, so it's just a matter of sitting in the saddle that much longer. We'll aim for 1 break in the latter part of the ride.

If you have not attended previous weeks in the program, you're welcome to join us, but this may be on the long side if you are a new rider. The club calendar will frequently have 7- and 11-mile routes for novices that you may want to try first. Alternatively, you're encouraged to try some of our previous routes on your own beforehand to build up your stamina.

**Venue & Misc**

There is ample parking at Kalberer soccer fields, and it has a public restroom that is typically open. We'll try to have some water on hand, but please bring any supplies you may need. It would be a good idea to bring a spare inner tube; Brian can carry lots of stuff, so even if you don't have a place for it, bring it anyway.

If you are not yet a member of the club ([please join!](http://wrcc-in.org/wp/?page_id=85)) and therefore not on the club listserv, feel free to send a note to (brianslick at mac dot com) if you have any questions beforehand, or wish to be notified of cancellations.
