### Week 13

We will resume our search for more distance by repeating our trip to the Klein Brot Haus bakery, but we're going to add a little more distance each way. Don't panic about the distance - the first time we'll go 30 miles! Just think of it as two 15-mile rides separated by a lengthy break. And pastries. We won't repeat the exact route from before, but we will cover some familiar roads.

If you have not attended previous weeks in the program, you're welcome to join us, but this will definitely be on the long side if you are a new rider. The club calendar will frequently have 7- and 11-mile routes for novices that you may want to try first. Alternatively, you're encouraged to try some of our previous routes on your own beforehand to build up your stamina.

**Venue & Misc**

There is ample parking at Kalberer soccer fields, and it has a public restroom that is typically open. We'll try to have some water on hand, but please bring any supplies you may need. It would be a good idea to bring a spare inner tube; Brian can carry lots of stuff, so even if you don't have a place for it, bring it anyway.

If you are not yet a member of the club ([please join!](http://wrcc-in.org/wp/?page_id=85)) and therefore not on the club listserv, feel free to send a note to (brianslick at mac dot com) if you have any questions beforehand, or wish to be notified of cancellations.
