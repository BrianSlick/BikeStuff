### Week 13

At last we have reached the final route of this training program. We're going to take what we did last week, add a few more miles in each direction, and enjoy the sense of completion that goes with a route _even longer_ than we'll cover next week at the Wabash River Ride. And we'll once again enjoy some pastries at the Klein Brot Haus bakery in Brookston.

If you have not attended previous weeks in the program, you're welcome to join us, but this will definitely be on the long side if you are a new rider. The club calendar will frequently have 7- and 11-mile routes for novices that you may want to try first. Alternatively, you're encouraged to try some of our previous routes on your own beforehand to build up your stamina: [Week 1](wrrtp_week1.md), [Week 2](wrrtp_week2.md), [Week 3](wrrtp_week3.md), [Week 4](wrrtp_week4.md), [Weeks 5/6](wrrtp_week5.md), [Week 8](wrrtp_week8.md), [Week 9](wrrtp_week9.md).

**Venue & Misc**

There is ample parking at Kalberer soccer fields, and it has a public restroom that is typically open. We'll try to have some water on hand, but please bring any supplies you may need. It would be a good idea to bring a spare inner tube; Brian can carry lots of stuff, so even if you don't have a place for it, bring it anyway.

If you are not yet a member of the club ([please join!](http://wrcc-in.org/wp/?page_id=85)) and therefore not on the club listserv, feel free to send a note to (brianslick at mac dot com) if you have any questions beforehand, or wish to be notified of cancellations.
