### Week 2

If we have any new faces this week, then we'll repeat the brief discussion of club guidelines and behaviors from last week. Or if any questions popped up after the first week, happy to answer those. Otherwise, we'll hit the multi-use trails, exploring even more of the Celery Bog area. This will be a 6-mile route, in a figure 8 so we'll come back to the start point half-way through, for a brief rest. As before, the ride leader will be available for extra distance for those that want it. We should easily finish by lunch time.

If you missed Week 1, no sweat! Come on out and join us anyway. If you have time to run the Week 1 route on your own, please do so, but it is not a requirement, and similar to what we will do today.

**Venue & Misc**

There is ample parking at the Lilly Nature Center, and it has a public restroom that is typically open (but I can't promise that year-round). Your ride leader, Brian, drives a red Toyota RAV4 and rides a greenish Giant hybrid bike with a big rear bag and lots of yellow tape. We'll try to have some water on hand, but please bring any supplies you may need. It would be a good idea to bring a spare inner tube; Brian can carry lots of stuff, so even if you don't have a place for it, bring it anyway.

If you are not yet a member of the club ([please join!](http://wrcc-in.org/wp/?page_id=85)) and therefore not on the club listserv, feel free to send a note to (brianslick at mac dot com) if you have any questions beforehand, or wish to be notified of cancellations.
