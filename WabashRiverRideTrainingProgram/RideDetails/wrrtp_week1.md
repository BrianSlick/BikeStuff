### Week 1

Our first ride will begin with a meet-n-greet, along with a brief discussion of club guidelines and behaviors. Then we'll explore some of the multi-use trails (sidewalks) that are available in the Celery Bog area. This will be an easy 3-mile loop. For those that might want to go farther, the ride leader will be available to repeat the loop. We should easily finish by lunch time.

There is ample parking at the Lilly Nature Center, and it has a public restroom that is typically open (but I can't promise that year-round). Your ride leader, Brian, drives a red Toyota RAV4 and rides a greenish Giant hybrid bike with a big rear bag and lots of yellow tape. We'll try to have some water on hand, but please bring any supplies you may need. It would be a good idea to bring a spare inner tube; Brian can carry lots of stuff, so even if you don't have a place for it, bring it anyway.

If you are not yet a member of the club ([please join!](http://wrcc-in.org/wp/?page_id=85)) and therefore not on the club listserv, feel free to send a note to (brianslick at mac dot com) if you have any questions beforehand, or wish to be notified of cancellations.
