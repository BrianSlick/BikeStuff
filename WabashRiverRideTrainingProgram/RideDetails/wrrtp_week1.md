### Week 1

Our first ride will begin with a meet-n-greet, along with a brief discussion of club guidelines and behaviors. Then we'll explore some of the multi-use trails (sidewalks) that are available in the Celery Bog area. This will be an easy 3-mile loop. For those that might want to go farther, the ride leader will be available to repeat the loop. We should easily finish by lunch time.

**Venue & Misc**

There is ample parking at the Lilly Nature Center, and it has a public restroom that is typically open (but I can't promise that year-round). Your ride leader, Brian, drives a red Toyota RAV4 and rides a greenish Giant hybrid bike with a big rear bag and lots of yellow tape. We'll try to have some water on hand, but please bring any supplies you may need. It would be a good idea to bring a spare inner tube; Brian can carry lots of stuff, so even if you don't have a place for it, bring it anyway.

If you are not yet a member of the club ([please join!](http://wrcc-in.org/wp/?page_id=85)) and therefore not on the club listserv, feel free to send a note to (brianslick at mac dot com) if you have any questions beforehand, or wish to be notified of cancellations.
