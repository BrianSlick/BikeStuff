# Wabash River Ride Training Program

Welcome to the [Wabash River Ride](http://wrcc-in.org/wp/?page_id=929) Training Program! This program is aimed squarely at novice riders. So whether you are new (or returning) to cycling, new to club/group rides, or just generally don't go very fast, this program is for you!

Starting the week after the [New Rider Callout](http://wrcc-in.org/wp/?page_id=2649), we will begin with a very short and slow route. Each week after that, we will gradually push the envelope. Gain confidence with distance, move a little faster, get some practice riding in a group.

The primary purpose of this program is to get new riders ready for the [Wabash River Ride](http://wrcc-in.org/wp/?page_id=929), but along the way we'll build up your confidence to tackle other [club rides](http://wrcc-in.org/wp/calendar/). Most Novice rides are under 15 miles, most E rides are 20-30 miles. Spend a few weeks with us and you'll be in a good position to identify which category you'd like to further pursue.

The full schedule is listed below. Please send any questions to (brianslick at mac dot com).
